"""
As long as it follows the logic LIFO or FIFO, you can call them Stack or Queue. 
You can use array, list, or LinkedList ...etc to implement. Stack or Queue are just a concepts.

It's very rare to ask solely on Stack or Queue. It come with other data structures at the same time.

Common problems for Queue/Stack
1. Fix window size sliding window
2. Floating size sliding window
3. Use Stack implement Queue, Deque
"""
# 1. How to implement a queue by using two stacks(please describe it)


# 2. How to implement the min() function, when using 2 stacks or ine stack one hash map with time complexity
# follow up, minimize duplicate store in stack / hash map!!
# note that it's impossible to do that with one stack, so multiple stacks mix with other data structure is possible


# 3. Sort number with two stack, the input has no duplicates and all are int -> Use selection sort concept
# Follow up: if it has duplicte and the value is float
    # use a counter until counter minus to 0


# 4. How to use multiple stacks to implement a deque. Prefer O(1) amortized time for all operations
# three stack 

# When to use stack? When you need to look at the latest value of the left side
